# Augmented-Reality-Testing
Testing and boilerplates for Augmented reality

#### jsARToolKit5
 - Initial testing using jsARToolKit5 + Three.js
 - Basic object / scene creation with a sphere, a cube with texture, sphere with texture, extruded text, and a Blender model (using JSON export)

#### TODO:
 - Having issues getting stereo to work properly
 - Testing so far as been local and using the laptop webcam, need to push to my hosted site for mobile testing
 - Current testing has been all on [Matrix Marker #20](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5/blob/master/doc/patterns/Matrix%20code%203x3%20(72dpi)/20.png), want to test using an image based marker
